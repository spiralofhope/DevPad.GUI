# Notes

- This is A fork of 
[saiket's _DevPad.GUI](https://github.com/Saiket/wow-saiket/_DevPad.GUI).
- I am a documentation guy, not a programmer.  It is unlikely I can make any large changes.
  -  If you are a developer, I am happy to:
     -  Accept GitHub pull requests.
     -  Add you as a contributor on GitHub.
     -  Hand this project over!



# Installation

Since it's a regular addon, it's manually installed the same as every other addon would be.

1) [Download _DevPad](https://github.com/spiralofhope/_DevPad/releases) 
and
   [Download _DevPad.GUI](https://github.com/spiralofhope/_DevPad.GUI/releases) 

2) Extract them to your `Interface\AddOns` folder.

Perhaps your game is installed to one of:

  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft` <br />
  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft (x86)` 

.. and so you would extract the contents of your downloaded archive to something like:

  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns` 

.. and so you would end up with two separate folders, like:

  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\_DevPad`
  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\_DevPad.GUI`

.. and inside them would be the files.  For example, you would have these two files:

  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\_DevPad\DevPad.toc`
  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\_DevPad.GUI\DevPad.toc`

# Issues and suggestions

([issues list](https://github.com/spiralofhope/_DevPad.GUI/issues))

- If you seen an error, disable all addons but this one and re-test before creating an issue.
  -  If you have multiple addons installed, errors you think are for one addon may actually be for another.  No really, disable everything else.
- Search for your issue before creating an issue.
- Always report errors.
  -  There are several helpful addons to catch errors.  Try something like TekErr ([github](https://github.com/TekNoLogic/tekErr) &middot;  [wowinterface](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info6681) &middot; [curse](https://mods.curse.com/project/103101) &middot; [curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/projects/103101/))
