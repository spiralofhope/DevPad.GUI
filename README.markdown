# Notes

- This addon is largely unchanged from saiket's efforts!
- I am a documentation guy, not a programmer.  It is unlikely I can make any real changes.
  -  If you are a developer, I am happy to:
     -  Accept GitHub pull requests.
     -  Add you as a contributor on GitHub.
     -  Hand this project over!



# Installation

Since it's a regular addon, it's manually installed the same as every other addon would be.

1) [Download _DevPad](https://github.com/spiralofhope/_DevPad/releases) 
and
   [Download _DevPad.GUI](https://github.com/spiralofhope/_DevPad.GUI/releases) 

2) Extract them to your `Interface\AddOns` folder.

Perhaps your game is installed to one of:

  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft` <br />
  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft (x86)` 

.. and so you would extract the contents of your downloaded archive to something like:

  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns` 

.. and so you would end up with two separate folders, like:

  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\_DevPad`
  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\_DevPad.GUI`

.. and inside them would be the files.

# Configuration / Usage

## Basic Usage

- `/devpad` will open the GUI.
- At the top-right of the window are icons.
- Click the new script icon.
- Type the name of your script.  To change a script name, double-click on the selected item on the left.
- Type your script on the right-window.
- Within the right-window is an icon at its top-left, for running a script.



## Intermediate Usage

Notes will be forthcoming.



## Advanced Usage

Notes will be forthcoming.

I have created some fairly advanced scripts I'd like to add as examples.



# Issues and suggestions

([issues list](https://github.com/spiralofhope/_DevPad.GUI/issues))

- If you seen an error, disable all addons but this one and re-test before creating an issue.
  -  If you have multiple addons installed, errors you think are for one addon may actually be for another.  No really, disable everything else.
- Search for your issue before creating an issue.
- Always report errors.
  -  There are several helpful addons to catch errors.  Try something like [TekErr](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info6681).
